# Software Reversing Lab - Concolic execution vs Model learning
*course: https://www.4tu.nl/cybsec/en/course-program/str/*

The objective of this lab was to apply KLEE and LearnLib to the RERS reachability problems (http://rers-challenge.org/), experiment with the toolâ€™s settings and discover which settings (eg. LearnLib's TTT algorithm) works best. In addition (as a bonus task) we combined KLEE and LearnLib in order to achieve size increase in learned models.

The report coverers the following questions:

* What are the sizes of models you can learn using LearnLib?
* Does LearnLib or KLEE reach more statements? 
* What is the benefit of using KLEE? 
* What is the benefit of using LearnLib? 


The report is available [here](concolic-learning-assignment.pdf).
